    // slowest component tests barely 3x from the cliff, which is why three
    // *different* tests went red on three unrelated PRs in one day. These
    // values keep every failure mode intact — a genuinely stuck test still
    // fails, just later — while removing the machine-speed lottery.

    // contention above. A `.ts` suite that does render is listed in
    // DOM_TS_SUITES so it gets the jsdom environment *and* the DOM setup file.
