/**
 * Backwards-compat redirect shim for Xendit sessions created before the cycle
 * `2026-04-27-finance-ui-polish` shipped. Those sessions have hardcoded
 * `cancel_return_url = /payment/cancel?invoice=<id>` and Xendit cannot
 * change the URL after creation. Session expiry is now derived from the
 * invoice's due date and capped at 30 days (cycle
 * 2026-08-20-invoice-due-date-to-gateway), so no session created before
 * 2026-04-27 can still be live — this shim is safe to delete whenever someone
 * is in here anyway.
 *
 * New sessions (either gateway) redirect directly to
 * `/parent/invoices?invoice=<id>&paymentStatus=cancel` — this shim now emits
 * the same gateway-neutral param (cycle 2026-07-27-doku-payment-gateway T3,
 * AC-24) for the rare pre-2026-04-27 session that still lands here.
