/**
 * The "up one level" link at the top of a portal detail page.
 *
 * The teacher portal had grown three of these: a bare `ChevronLeft` + section
 * name at 20px tall with no focus ring (Penilaian Pekanan, Sentra), an
 * `ArrowLeft` + "Kembali" button at 44px with a ring (the per-student week
 * view), and nothing at all on the session roster. Two icons, two labels and
 * two tap sizes for one job, one tap apart. This is the one.
 *
 * `ArrowLeft` over `ChevronLeft` deliberately: a chevron is the disclosure
 * glyph used by every list row in the portal to mean "go deeper", so pointing
 * one backwards at the top of the page reuses a symbol that already means
 * something else.
