/**
 * Hourly payment reconciliation sweep — the safety net for a gateway
 * notification that never arrives.
 *
 * ### Why this exists
 *
 * Under DOKU Virtual Account the notification is the only *push* signal that a
 * parent paid: they get a VA number and pay at an ATM hours later, with no
 * redirect back. If that notification is lost, the money is collected by the
 * gateway and Talib shows nothing — the invoice sits at SENT, the parent
 * believes they have paid, and the admin has no error to react to. Silent, and
 * the worst possible failure mode for a billing system.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. As of cycle 2026-07-29-doku-all-va-channels, a
 * `WebhookEvent` audit showed **zero** DOKU notifications had ever verified —
 * every DOKU payment on staging was credited by an admin manually pressing
 * "Perbarui pembayaran". A live sandbox payment reproduced it: DOKU recorded
 * the settlement (the status poll found it) but no notification was delivered.
 * The Xendit route, by contrast, has real webhook rows. So the push path is
 * unreliable in practice while the pull path works.
 *
 * This route makes the pull path automatic instead of depending on an admin
 * noticing. It does not replace the webhook — when a notification does arrive
 * it still credits immediately, and this sweep then no-ops on the dedup.
 *
 * ### Why it is safe to run repeatedly
 *
 * It performs no state transitions of its own. `reconcileInvoicePayment` polls
 * the gateway read-only and hands the result to the same `processPaymentEvent`
 * the webhook uses, so every guard applies verbatim: the durable WebhookEvent
 * receipt, the deterministic `eventId` → P2002 dedup, the per-invoice advisory
 * lock, the amount/currency checks, the overpayment tolerance, and the
 * PAID/CANCELLED short-circuits. Re-running is a no-op by construction.
 *
 * Auth mirrors `/api/cron/finance-maintenance`: `Authorization: Bearer
 * ${CRON_SECRET}` plus a `vercel-cron/` User-Agent, both fail-closed.

/**
 * Cap per run. Each candidate costs one outbound gateway call, and Vercel
 * caps function duration — an unbounded sweep over a full billing cycle's
 * invoices would time out and reconcile nothing at all.
 *
 * Ordering is `dueDate asc` (indexed, and the most-overdue invoice is the one
 * whose missing payment hurts most). Note this is a *priority* order, not a
 * rotation: if outstanding invoices ever exceed this cap for a sustained
 * period, the newest-due tail would never be polled. `cappedAtLimit` in the
 * response exists to make that visible before it becomes a problem — with the
 * pilot's ~179 students it is not one today.
