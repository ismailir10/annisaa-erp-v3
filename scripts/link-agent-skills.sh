#!/usr/bin/env bash
# link-agent-skills.sh — point Codex's gitignored .agents/skills/* at the
# canonical .claude/skills/* so every harness reads ONE source of truth.
#
# Why this exists: Codex resolves its slash-command skills from .agents/skills/,
# which is gitignored (harness-local) and therefore drifts from .claude/skills/.
# A stale .agents/skills/ship/SKILL.md is how a fixed canonical skill fails to
# reach Codex. Because .agents is gitignored we cannot commit the symlinks; this
# script (idempotent) recreates them at setup + SessionStart instead.
#
# Scope: the workflow skills Codex invokes, plus the vendored interface-craft
# skills /build loads on frontend tasks (see .claude/skills/VENDORED.md).
# Adding a new skill Codex must see? add its name to the right list below.
