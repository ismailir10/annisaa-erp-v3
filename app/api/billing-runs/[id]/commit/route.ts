/**
 * POST /api/billing-runs/[id]/commit
 *
 * Body: `{ rowIds }` — one chunk of at most 25 `BillingRunRow` ids (per
 * `commitBillingRunSchema`). The wizard's client orchestrator
 * (`lib/finance/run-bulk-generate.ts`, repointed by T10) calls this
 * repeatedly, chunking a whole run.
 *
 * Order of operations (mirrors the numbered spec in the Cycle B1 doc):
 *   1. Load the run, tenant-scoped; 409 unless DRAFT or COMMITTING.
 *   2. Load the named rows scoped to this run, with lines. Ids that don't
 *      belong to this run are silently dropped by the `billingRunId` filter.
 *   3. Skip non-committable rows — anything not `PENDING` with a null
 *      `invoiceId` (already COMMITTED, EXCLUDED, any SKIPPED_* status, or a
 *      row that already carries an invoiceId). This is the idempotency
 *      guard: a row is committable at most once, full stop.
 *   4. Re-check duplicates against LIVE `Invoice` rows (not the draft) for
 *      the survivors — `(tenantId, periodLabel, studentId IN …)`. A hit
 *      flips that row to SKIPPED_ALREADY_INVOICED and writes nothing further
 *      for it. This runs strictly BEFORE the invoice-creation transaction,
 *      on the post-idempotency-filter row set, so a row can never both pass
 *      this check and be a duplicate committed elsewhere between draft and
 *      commit.
 *   5. For the remaining survivors, in ONE transaction: reserve invoice
 *      numbers, createMany invoices (status PENDING_PAYMENT_LINK), re-query
 *      to recover ids, createMany lines copied verbatim from the draft
 *      lines, then flip each row's invoiceId + status COMMITTED.
 *   6. If this chunk has survivors and the run is still DRAFT, flip it to
 *      COMMITTING — done right before starting the transaction in step 5,
 *      i.e. when the first chunk of actual work starts.
 *   7. After the transaction: best-effort payment-session fan-out at
 *      concurrency 2, exactly as the batch route. A fan-out failure never
 *      rolls back the committed invoices — it only leaves the invoice at
 *      PENDING_PAYMENT_LINK with a persisted paymentLinkError for retry.
 *   8. If no PENDING rows remain on the run afterward, flip it to COMMITTED.
