/**
 * Pure classifier + materializer for the Billing Run wizard draft (Cycle B1
 * — docs/cycles/2026-08-14-billing-run-wizard.md, Task T3).
 *
 * Given already-fetched data, resolves the in-scope student set, classifies
 * each student into PENDING / already-invoiced / no-fee-structure, and
 * materializes rows + lines through `applyAdjustments` (the Cycle A resolver
 * — reused unchanged, never reimplemented). No Prisma queries happen here —
 * the route (T4) does the querying and passes plain data in, so this stays
 * unit-testable without mocking Prisma.
 *
 * Cycle `enrollment-flexibility` (T8) — a student may hold more than one
 * in-scope ACTIVE enrollment at once (e.g. one school + one daycare
 * program), so candidates are grouped by studentId and ALL of a student's
 * in-scope enrollments contribute fee lines to a single merged row, rather
 * than the first one winning.
