"""Assert every workflow step that reaches the GitHub API has GH_REPO set.

`gh` resolves the target repository from GH_REPO or, failing that, from the git
remote of the working directory. A workflow job with neither dies on its first
command with `fatal: not a git repository` — before reaching the API, and with
an error that names git rather than the real problem.

That is not hypothetical. backup.yml's alert and resolve jobs had exactly this
defect from 2026-08-22 to 2026-09-09: 122 consecutive red backup runs opened
zero issues, because the alarm could not resolve the repository it was meant to
open an issue on. This guard is why that cannot come back silently.

Steps are checked whether they call `gh` directly or go through
scripts/alert-issue.sh, which needs the same context.

Usage: python3 scripts/check-workflow-gh-repo.py .github/workflows/*.yml
       python3 scripts/check-workflow-gh-repo.py --self-test
