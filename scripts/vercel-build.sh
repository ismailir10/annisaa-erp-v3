# vercel-build.sh — build step for Vercel deploys.
#
# Applies Prisma migrations on the `staging` and `main` branches. Both
# deploy targets are now live: staging gets migrations on every push,
# main gets them on the staging→main promote PR. Preview branches (feat/*)
# never run migrate deploy — they use the staging DB or ephemeral Supabase
# branches.
#
# This is the enforcement arm for the staging→main promote flow:
# `prisma migrate deploy` is idempotent (only applies new migrations)
# and will fail the deploy loudly if prod schema has drifted. Do not
# skip or silently continue — a schema/code mismatch in prod is a P0.
