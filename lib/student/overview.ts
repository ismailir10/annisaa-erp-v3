 * dossier's number tiles depend on is unit-testable without a database.
 *
 * The one number deliberately NOT computed here is **outstanding**. Increment 2
 * gave that exactly one owner — `summarizeStudentInvoices` in
 * `lib/finance/student-invoice-summary.ts`, shared with the parent portal after
 * the UAT-2026-05-03 INV-01 disagreement. A `groupBy` sum cannot reproduce its
 * per-row `remaining > 0` post-filter (an overpaid invoice would net against an
 * underpaid one inside the same status bucket), so this module returns the
 * per-status *breakdown* and leaves "what does this family owe" where it is.
