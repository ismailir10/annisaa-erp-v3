   * limitation was a real bug: before cycle 2026-08-20-invoice-due-date-to-gateway

   * passed a hardcoded `7` — so every Virtual Account expired 7 days after it
   * was issued regardless of the due date the admin had set on the invoice.
   * An invoice raised on the 1st with a month-end due date handed the parent a
   * VA that stopped working on the 8th.
   *
   * Each adapter converts as its API requires: Xendit takes the ISO instant
   * directly (`expires_at`), DOKU takes minutes-from-now (`payment_due_date`).
   *
   * The 7-day default survives for callers that have no invoice and therefore
   * no due date (the DOKU probe route, the reseed and finish-xendit scripts).
   * The invoice path must never reach it — `lib/payments/__tests__/session-expiry.test.ts`
   * asserts that.
