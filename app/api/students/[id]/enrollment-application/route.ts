/**
 * GET /api/students/[id]/enrollment-application — the original pendaftaran form
 * this student was converted from, read-only.
 *
 * The paper form carries far more than `convert` copies onto the Student and
 * Parent rows: the father's and mother's employer blocks, the birth
 * circumstances, the family's prior attendees, and the signed consent letter.
 * All of it was reachable only if an admin already knew the application existed
 * and clicked through the provenance link in the rail — so in practice it was
 * orphaned the moment the student record was created.
 *
 * Resolved by **`EnrollmentApplication.studentId`**, the FK `convert` sets
 * inside its transaction — not by the `fromEnrollmentApplication` pointer in
 * `Student.metadata`. The metadata copy is a display convenience an admin can
 * edit; the FK is the record.
 *
 * 404 when this student did not come from a form (a hand-entered student), so
 * the dossier can simply omit the section.
 *
 * Admin-only, tenant-scoped. Closed-set `select`: `accessToken` and
 * `tokenExpiresAt` are the parent's unguessable form credentials and have no
 * business on an admin page payload. `consentData` embeds a signature
 * storage token per parent, redacted to a presence boolean before it leaves
 * this route — see lib/enrollment/sanitize-consent.ts.
