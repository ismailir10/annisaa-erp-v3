# Talib — by An Nisaa' Sekolahku

School management platform for **An Nisaa' Sekolahku**, an Islamic PAUD/TKIT in Bekasi, Indonesia — two campuses, 40+ teachers, 500+ students. *Talib* (طالب) means "seeker of knowledge".

**Production:** [talib.annisaasekolahku.com](https://talib.annisaasekolahku.com)

> Engineering identifier: `school-erp` (npm package + repo name). Product name: Talib. Same codebase.

Source is public; school data and secrets are not. Deployed single-tenant — a second tenant needs tenant-from-host resolution in `lib/auth.ts`, currently keyed on email and guarded by `assertSingleTenant()`.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router), TypeScript strict |
| Database | Supabase Postgres (Singapore `ap-southeast-1`); Prisma datasource is Postgres-only, so local dev points at a Postgres too |
| ORM | Prisma 7 |
| Auth | Supabase Auth — Google OAuth only, invitation-only. `/auth/callback` gates on an ACTIVE `User`/`Employee`/`Parent` row |
| UI | Shadcn UI + Tailwind + TanStack Table; Plus Jakarta Sans + JetBrains Mono |
| Payments | Pluggable `PaymentGateway` port ([`lib/payments/`](lib/payments/)) — DOKU Checkout or Xendit, selected by `PAYMENT_GATEWAY` |
| Email | Resend |
| PDF | `@react-pdf/renderer` |
| Hosting | Vercel (`sin1`) |
| CI | GitHub Actions — docs sync, lint + typecheck + unit, build, Playwright |

## Modules

Nine domain modules. Seven are stable; `curriculum` and `reportCard` are mid-cutover for the 2026 PROMES/Penilaian/Raport switch. The Parent portal is a view *across* students, finance and learning rather than its own module.

| Module | Domain |
|--------|--------|
| **core** | Auth, tenant, multi-campus config, holiday calendar, email log |
| **hr** | Staff lifecycle — employees, attendance, leave, payroll, salary components; gated by `hr.*` permissions |
| **academic** | School structure — academic years with one-click roll-forward, programs, classes, daily sessions with substitute swap, teaching assignments, bulk promotion |
| **students** | Student lifecycle — auth-proxied photo upload, guardians (one parent record shared across siblings; Tambah Wali searches first, with an overridable duplicate warning on name, phone, NIK or email), enrollments (one school plus one day-care placement per year; age bands advisory, overridden with an audited reason), admissions (`/daftar` inquiry → token → form → convert), CSV export. Detail is a single-scroll dossier — hash-addressable sections, NIK/KK masked, read-only Keuangan / Keringanan / Jurnal / Akademik / Pendaftaran, rail tiles from one aggregate route |
| **finance** | Fees and payments — invoice state machine, hosted checkout through the gateway port, webhook + manual reconciliation sharing one durable processor, three-step Billing Run wizard for bulk invoicing, per-student fee adjustments (*keringanan*), kuitansi PDF, payments-received ledger |
| **learning** | Attendance, including the admin monthly recap and CSV export. The legacy BB/MB/BSH/BSB assessment stack was removed in 2026 and superseded by `curriculum` + `reportCard` |
| **student-journal** | *Buku Penghubung* — bi-directional school/home indicators with an audit trail, plus a week-independent note thread carrying unread markers per reader |
| **curriculum** *(cutover)* | PROMES spine — Semester → Theme → SubTheme → Week, Objective → Indicator. Admin CRUD, xlsx import, the teacher assessment write path (walas weekly + sentra daily), admin monitor, parent *perkembangan* rollup. Three-level skala |
| **reportCard** *(cutover)* | Triwulan report cards aggregated from penilaian — auto-drafted per student, admin override, publish, PDF, parent read. *Bank Narasi* narrative templates per term × age group |

## Portals

| Portal | Route | Role | Layout | Access |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Public | `/daftar` | — | Mobile-first | Admission inquiry, three steps |
| Public | `/pendaftaran/[token]` | — | Mobile-first | Full enrollment form via emailed token — six steps, autosave + resume |
| Admin (owner) | `/admin` | `SUPER_ADMIN` | Desktop sidebar | Everything, including payroll and salary |
| Admin (staff) | `/admin` | `SCHOOL_ADMIN` | Desktop sidebar | Students, admissions, academics, attendance, invoices, employees |
| Teacher | `/teacher` | `TEACHER` | Mobile-first | Own attendance and leave; assigned classes only |
| Parent | `/parent` | `GUARDIAN` | Mobile-first | Own children only |

All portals share the same chrome — An Nisaa' logo, "Talib" wordmark, "by An Nisaa' Sekolahku" sub-label — and the Indonesian voice defined in [`.claude/standards/voice.md`](.claude/standards/voice.md). Legal pages: `/legal/terms`, `/legal/privacy`.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ismailir10/annisaa-erp-v3.git
cd annisaa-erp-v3
npm install
./scripts/install-hooks.sh
npx prisma generate && npx prisma db push && npx prisma db seed
npm run dev     # http://localhost:3000 — DEMO_MODE bypasses Google auth; a DB is still required
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` first. Variable reference: [`docs/runbooks/environments.md`](docs/runbooks/environments.md).

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Gate before every commit | `npm run build && npx vitest run` |
| End-to-end | `npx playwright test` |
| Lint / types | `npm run lint` · `npm run typecheck` |
| Doc-staleness gate | `bash scripts/audit-docs.sh` |

## Architecture Decisions

Constraints from the last 60 days live in [`docs/adrs/active.md`](docs/adrs/active.md); everything older is in [`docs/adrs/archive.md`](docs/adrs/archive.md). Per-cycle engineering history is in [`docs/cycles/`](docs/cycles/), swept into [`docs/cycles/archive/`](docs/cycles/archive/) monthly.

## Contributing

How this repo is worked — the `/spec` → `/build` → `/ship` loop, testing gates, branch protection, standards — is documented in [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md). Operational procedure lives in [`docs/runbooks/`](docs/runbooks/).
